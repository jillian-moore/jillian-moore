# Welcome! I'm Jillian Moore.

I’m a student at Northwestern University pursuing a double major in Economics and Journalism with a minor in Data Science.

Below are a few highlights — feel free to explore my repos or reach out!

## Coursework
My academic background combines data science, programming, and applied data journalism. Highlights include:
- **Knight Lab: Studio (Medill School of Journalism)**: currently collaborating with four peers on a faculty-supervised project, developing a *Local Coverage Tracker* tool that scrapes and analyzes local news to detect bias and underrepresentation
- **Scientific Programming in Python**: implemented linear algebra and complex math algorithms in Python, data cleaning for large research datasets
- **Data Science sequence in R (3 courses):** statistical modeling, natural language processing, feature engineering, predictive analytics
- **Advanced Econometrics**: conducted regression analyses, applied econometric methods such as Difference-in-Differences, replicated economic research papers (primarily using Stata)
- **Introduction to Data Journalism**: extracted and cleaned datasets from web pages and PDFs, data transformation and cleaning, developed interactive and static data visualizations
- **Introduction to Programming for Data Science**: applied Python and R to data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and basic machine learning workflows  
- **Introduction to Computer Programming**: learned core programming principles (algorithms, control flow, debugging, problem decomposition, etc.) as a foundation for advanced coding projects

## Skills and Tools
- **Languages:** Python, R, Stata
- **Data & ML Libraries:** pandas, numpy, tidyverse, tidymodels, BeautifulSoup  
- **Visualization:** ggplot2, matplotlib, Shiny, interactive dashboards  
- **Tools:** Git/GitHub, RStudio, Jupyter

## Featured Projects
- **Knight Lab: Local Coverage Tracker** — Designing a Shiny dashboard and API-based data pipeline to analyze thousands of news articles for representation and bias
- **Regression & Classification Prediction Projects** — Built pipelines for text classification and regression tasks: data cleaning, feature engineering, model comparison, and error analysis in a competitive class leaderboard 
- **Austin Animal Shelter and Illinois Report Card Analysis Projects** — Produced interactive and static visualizations, performed cross-tab analysis, and created polished dashboards for communicating insights

(See **Pinned** repositories on my profile for full project code and write-ups.)
